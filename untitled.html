<div>In recent years, Bioinformatics has seen thousands of new software tools appearing. These can be, e.g., libraries that expose certain algorithms or models, or standalone, e.g., command line applications that perform often long-running and computationally expensive tasks like read mapping or variant calling. The former are typically (but not exclusively) written in scripting languages like Python, R, Ruby, or Perl, while the latter are often implemented in compiled, high performance languages like C/C++ and Java. This diversity is also reflected in the methods of installation. For example, scripting languages usually deliver their own package management tools that allow to install, update and delete packages while handling dependencies. Importantly, these tools can usually only handle dependencies within the same language, such that external dependencies (i.e., a C library), have to be installed manually. Software written in C/C++ usually has to be compiled manually or via, e.g., make files. Finally, published scientific software often simply consists of a custom collection of scripts together with a textual description of the manual steps that have to be conducted in order to use the software. This diversity makes the management of a software stack a complicated and error-prone task. Moreover, it defeats the important goal of reproducible science&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mesirov_2010,Baker_2016,Munaf__2017}</cite> because it is largely non-trivial to reproduce such a software stack on a different machine.</div><div>The Conda package manager (<a href="https://conda.pydata.org">https://conda.pydata.org</a>) has become an increasingly popular approach to overcome these limitations. Conda allows normalization of software installations across language ecosystems by describing a software via a&nbsp;<i>recipe</i> that defines meta information and dependencies as well as a&nbsp;<i>build script</i> that essentially conducts the steps that are needed to install a software. Conda extracts the results of the installation from a sandboxed environment and transforms them into a relocatable binary. The resulting packages have minimal system requirements (a minimum libc version has to be available), and linking to libraries within the build using relative import paths. Conda packages can be built for all three major operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows). Importantly, installation and management of packages requires no administration privileges, such that the data scientist  gains control over the available software tools regardless of the infrastructure. Moreover, Conda allows users to generate isolated software environments, such that versions and tools can be rapidly exchanged and managed per-project instead of relying on a system-wide installation. Finally, it is well integrated into popular solutions for reproducible scientific data analysis like Galaxy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{27137889}</cite>, bcbio-nextgen (<a href="https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen">https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen</a>), and Snakemake&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{22908215}</cite>.</div><div>In order to unlock the benefits of Conda for the life sciences, the Bioconda project was founded in 2015. The mission of Bioconda is to make any&nbsp;relevant bioinformatics software easily installable and manageable via the Conda package manager. Via it's channel for the Conda package manager, Bioconda provides currently over 2900 software packages for Linux and macOS. Development is driven by a community of over 200 international scientists. In the last years, both numbers have increased, on average, linearly (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>a). Bioconda provides packages from various language ecosystems like Python, R (CRAN), Perl, Bioconductor, and a plethora of C/C++ programs (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>b,&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{209284}</span>a). With over 5.9 million downloads, the service has been well adopted (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>c). Bioconda is complemented by the conda-forge project (<a href="https://conda-forge.github.io">https://conda-forge.github.io</a>), which covers all other, not specifically bioinformatics related software tools.</div>
