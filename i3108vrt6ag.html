<h1 data-label="419034" class="ltx_title_section">          Introduction</h1><div>Thousands of new software tools have been released for bioinformatics in recent years. Many of these tools do not just accompany a scientific publication, but represent its primary methodological result in easily reusable form. Together, the body of bioinformatics software comprises a significant proportion of scientific progress made in the field. Moreover, the software implementations of novel algorithms and methods are essential as interface between the data analyst and method development sides of bioinformatics. However, the distribution and deployment of these tools currently consumes inordinate amounts of time on both sides. While popular scripting languages such as R and Python include streamlined distribution mechanisms, scientific&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>that allow softwares to be Method developers often choose to re-implement algorithms over using existing software to minimize the issues&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>, in a variety of programming languages. Accompanying this diversity of construction is an array of installation methods. Software written in C/C++ often has to be compiled manually for different hardware architectures and operating systems, with management left to the user or system administrator. Scripting languages usually deliver their own package management tools for installing, updating, and removing packages, though these are often limited in scope to packages written in the same scripting language, such that external dependencies (e.g., C libraries) have to be installed manually. </div><div>Published scientific software often consists of simple collections of custom scripts distributed with textual descriptions of the manual steps required to use the software. New analyses often require novel combinations of multiple tools, and the heterogeneity of scientific software makes management of a software stack complicated and error-prone. </div><div>Moreover, it inhibits reproducible science&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mesirov_2010,Baker_2016,Munaf__2017}</cite> because it is  hard to reproduce a software stack on different machines. System-wide deployment of software has traditionally been handled by administrators, but reproducibility often requires that the researcher (who is often not an expert in administration) is able to maintain full control of the software environment and rapidly modify it without administrative privileges.</div><div>The Conda package manager (<a href="https://conda.io" target="_blank">https://conda.io</a>) has become an increasingly popular approach to overcome these challenges. Conda normalizes software installations across language ecosystems by describing each software package with&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>recipe</i> that defines meta-information and dependencies, as well as a&nbsp;<i>build script</i> that performs the steps necessary to build and install the software. Conda prepares and builds software packages within an isolated environment, transforming them into relocatable binaries. Conda packages can be built for all three major operating systems: Linux, macOS, and Windows. Importantly, installation and management of packages requires no administrative privileges, such that a researcher can control the available software tools regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Moreover, Conda obviates reliance on system-wide installation by allowing users to generate isolated software environments, within which versions and tools can be managed per-project, without generating conflicts or incompatibilies (see online methods). These environments support reproducibility, as they can can be rapidly exchanged via files that describe their installation state. Conda is tightly integrated into popular solutions for reproducible scientific data analysis like Galaxy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{27137889}</cite>, bcbio-nextgen (<a href="https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen">https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen</a>), and Snakemake&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{22908215}</cite>. Finally, while Conda provides many commonly-used packages by default, it also allows users to optionally include additional repositories (termed&nbsp;<i>channels)</i>&nbsp;of packages that can be installed.</div><h1 data-label="677317" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In order to unlock the benefits of Conda for the life sciences, the Bioconda project was founded in 2015. The mission of Bioconda is to make  bioinformatics software easily installable and manageable via the Conda package manager. Via its channel for the Conda package manager, Bioconda currently provides  over 2500 software packages for Linux and macOS. Development is driven by an open community of over 200 international scientists. In the prior two years, package count and the number of contributors have increased linearly, on average, with no sign of saturation (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>a,b).&nbsp;The barrier to entry is low, requiring a willingness to participate and adherence to community guidelines. Many software developers contribute recipes for their own tools, and many Bioconda contributors are invested in the project as they are also users of Conda and Bioconda. Bioconda provides packages from various language ecosystems like Python, R (CRAN and Bioconductor), Perl, Haskell, as well as a plethora of C/C++ programs (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>c). Many of these packages have complex dependency structures that require various manual steps to install when not relying on a package manager like Conda (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{209284}</span>a, Online Methods). With over 5.9 million downloads, the service has  become a backbone of bioinformatics infrastructure (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>d).  Bioconda is complemented by the conda-forge project (<a href="https://conda-forge.github.io">https://conda-forge.github.io</a>), which hosts software not specifically related to the biological sciences. The two projects collaborate closely, and the Bioconda team maintains over 500 packages hosted by conda-forge. Among all currently available distributions of bioinformatics software, Bioconda is by far the most comprehensive, while being among the youngest (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{209284}</span>d).</div>
