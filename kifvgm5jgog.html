<h2 data-label="174970" class="ltx_title_subsection">How isolated software environments enable reproducible research</h2><div>With isolated software environments as shown above, it is possible to define an exact version for each package. This increases reproducibility by eliminating differences due to implementation changes. Note that above we also pin an R version, although the latest compatible one would also be automatically installed without mentioning it. To further increase reproducibility, this pattern can be extended to all dependencies of DESeq2 and Salmon and recursively down to basic system libraries like zlib and boost (<a href="https://www.boost.org">https://www.boost.org</a>). Environments are isolated from the rest of the system, while still allowing interaction with it: e.g. tools inside the environment are preferred over system tools, while system tools that are not available from within the environment can still be used. Conda also supports the automatic creation of  environment definitions from already existing environments. This allows to rapidly explore the needed combination of packages before it is finalized into an environment definition. When used with workflow management systems like Galaxy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{27137889}</cite>, bcbio-nextgen (<a href="https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen">https://github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen</a>), and Snakemake&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{22908215}</cite> that interact directly with Conda, a data analysis can be shipped and deployed in a fully reproducible way, from description and automatic execution of every analysis step down to the description and automatic installation of any required software.</div><h2 data-label="922199" class="ltx_title_subsection">Notes on Conda Build and Relocatable Binaries</h2><div>Conda builds&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{documentation}</cite> relocatable binaries by including everything that is needed for a particular software into that conda environment, and linking to the appropriate libraries using a relative path. Generally, when compiling software from source, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable is set to tell the software where to look for its library. If the LD_LIBRARY_PATH becomes set incorrectly, unset, or superseded by another software stack, the software would fail. Conda build instead uses RPATH, which hardcodes the linked libraries to a path relative to the binary within the conda environment. During the install process it changes from a linked path to an absolute path by substituting the original conda build prefix with the actual prefix.</div><div>This is especially useful in bioinformatics, where a single analysis can have an very complex software dependency tree. A researcher may install a software that depends upon samtools &lt; 1.0, such as soapdenovo2. They may also want to use a newer version of samtools for some upstream manipulation of bam files. This situation would be impossible if the user where trying to install them as root, as having two versions of samtools would not be possible. It would also be impossible if the user were trying to use these in an HPC module system where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the norm, and layering modules without an underlying knowledge of the linked libraries.</div><h2 data-label="406761" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conda on HPC</h2><div>The conda ecosystem lends itself very well to traditional HPC module configurations, while allowing users without administrative privileges full control over their software stacks. An administrator can deploy one or more conda environments as an HPC module. These can be grouped together to give a variety of different combinations of interfaces for different analysis disciplines, projects, and labs by mixing and matching available software stacks. Under the hood administrators and users will use the same process, which is a greater gain to reproducible research. It makes the process of onboarding new users to HPC much easier, as any user has access to the same level of sophistication in software builds as an experienced applications specialist.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="779845" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data analysis</h2><div>The presented figures have been generated via a fully automated, reproducible Snakemake&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{22908215}</cite> workflow that is freely available under&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-paper">https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-paper</a>.</div>
