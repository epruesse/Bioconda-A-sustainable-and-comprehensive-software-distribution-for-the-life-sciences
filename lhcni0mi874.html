<div>Reproducible software management and distribution is enhanced by other current technologies.&nbsp;Conda integrates itself well with environment modules (<a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/">http://modules.sourceforge.net/</a>), a technology used nearly universally across HPC systems. An administrator can use Conda to easily define  software stacks for multiple labs and project-specific configurations. Popularized by Docker, containers provide another way to publish an entire software stack, down to the operating system. They provide greater isolation and control over the environment a software is executed in, at the expense of some customizability. Conda complements container-based approaches. Where flexibility is needed, Conda packages can be used and combined directly. Where the uniformity  of containers is required, Conda can be used to build  images without having to reproduce the nuanced installation steps that would ordinarily be required to build and install an application within an image. In fact, for each Bioconda package, the build system automatically builds a minimal Docker image containing that package, which is subsequently uploaded and made available via the Biocontainers project&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{28379341}</cite>. As a consequence, every built Bioconda package is available not only for installation via Conda, but also directly available as a container via Docker, Rkt (<a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">https://coreos.com/rkt</a>), and Singularity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{28494014}</cite>.</div><h1 data-label="835457" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>For reproducible data science, it is crucial that software libraries and tools are provided via an easy to use, unified interface, such that they can be easily deployed and sustainably managed. With its ability to maintain isolated software environments, the integration into major workflow management systems and the fact that no administration privileges are needed, the Conda package manager is the ideal tool to ensure sustainable and reproducible software management. With Bioconda, we unlock Conda for the life sciences and coordinate closely with other related projects such as conda-forge and Biocontainers. Bioconda offers a comprehensive resource of thousands of software libraries and tools that is maintained by hundreds of international scientists. With almost six million downloads so far, Bioconda packages have been well received by the community. We invite everybody to participate in reaching the goal of a central, comprehensive, and language agnostic collection of easily installable software by maintaining existing or publishing new software in Bioconda.</div><h1 data-label="186536" class="ltx_title_section">Funding</h1><div>The Bioconda project has received support from&nbsp;Anaconda, Inc., Austin, TX, USA, in the form of expanded storage for Bioconda packages on their hosting service (<a href="https://anaconda.org">https://anaconda.org</a>). Further, the project has been granted extended build times from Travis CI, GmbH (<a href="https://travis-ci.com/">https://travis-ci.com</a>). The Bioconda community also would like to thank ELIXIR (<a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/">https://www.elixir-europe.org</a>) for their constant support.</div><h1 data-label="201750" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgments</h1><div>We thank the participants of various hackathons (e.g., the GalaxyP and IUC contribution fest, ELIXIR BioContainers and NETTAB hackathon) for porting numerous packages to Bioconda.</div><h1 data-label="164035" class="ltx_title_section">Contributions</h1><div>Kyle Beauchamp, Christian Brueffer, Brad Chapman, Ryan Dale, Florian Eggenhofer, Björn Grüning,  Johannes Köster, Elmar Pruesse, Martin Raden, Jillian Rowe, Devon Ryan, Ilya Shlyakter, Andreas Sjödin, Christopher Tomkins-Tinch, and Renan Valieris (in alphabetical order) have written the manuscript.

Ensuring (a) is up to the user. In contrast, (b) is handled by our workflow. First, source code or binary files defined in recipes are checked for integrity via MD5 or SHA256 hash values. Second, all review and testing steps are enforced via the Github interface. This way, it is guaranteed that all packages have been tested automatically and reviewed by a human being. Third, all changes to the repository of recipes are publicly tracked, and all build and test steps are transparently visible to the user. Finally, the automatic parts of the development workflow are implemented in the open-source software&nbsp;<i>bioconda-utils</i> (<a href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils">https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils</a>). In the future, we will further explore the possibility to sign packages cryptographically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="564043" class="ltx_title_subsection">Software management with Conda</h2><div>Via the Conda package manager, installing software from Bioconda becomes  very simple. In the following, we describe the basic functionality assuming that the user has access to a Linux or macOS terminal. After installing Conda, the first step is to set up the Bioconda channel via:</div>
