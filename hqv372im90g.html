<div>To ensure reliable maintenance of such numbers of packages, we use a semi-automatic, agent-assisted development workflow (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{209284}</span>b). All Bioconda recipes are hosted in a GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes">https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes</a>). Both the addition of new recipes and the update of existing recipes in Bioconda is handled via&nbsp;<i>pull requests</i>. Thereby, a modified version of one or more recipes is compared against the current state of Bioconda. Once a pull request arrives, our infrastructure performs several automatic checks.  Problems discovered in any step are reported to the contributor and further progress is blocked until they are resolved. First, the modified recipes are checked for syntactic anti-patterns, i.e., formulations that are syntactically correct but bad style (termed <i>linting</i>). Second, the modified recipes are built on Linux and macOS, via a cloud based, free-of-charge service (<a href="https://travis-ci.org">https://travis-ci.org</a>). Successfully built recipes are tested (e.g., by running the generated executable). Since Bioconda packages must be able to run on any supported system, it is important to check that the built packages do not rely on particular elements from the build environment. Therefore, testing happens in two stages: (a) test cases are executed in the build environment (b) test cases are executed in a minimal Docker (<a href="https://docker.com">https://docker.com</a>) container which purposefully lacks all non-common system libraries (hence a dependency that is not explicitly defined  will lead to a failure). Once the&nbsp;<i>build</i> and&nbsp;<i>test</i> steps have succeeded, a member of the Bioconda team reviews the proposed changes and, if acceptable, merges the modifications into the official repository. Upon merging, the recipes are built again and uploaded to the hosted Bioconda channel (<a href="https://anaconda.org/bioconda">https://anaconda.org/bioconda</a>), where they become available via the Conda package manager. When a Bioconda package is updated to a new version, older builds are generally preserved, and recipes for multiple older versions may be maintained in the Bioconda repository. The usual turnaround time of above workflow is fast (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{209284}</span>d). 61% of the pull requests are merged within 5 hours. Of those, 36% are even merged within 1 hour. Only 18% of the pull requests need more than a day. Hence, publishing software in Bioconda or updating already existing packages can be accomplished typically within minutes to a few hours.</div>
