<div data-label="497928">Bioconda development and usage since the beginning of the project. (a) contributing authors and added recipes over time. (b) code line additions and deletions per week. (c) package count per language ecosystem (saturated colors on bottom represent explicitly life science related packages). (d) total downloads per language ecosystem. The term "other" entails all recipes that do not fall into one of the specific case. Note that a subset of packages that started in Bioconda have since been migrated to the more appropriate, general-purpose conda-forge channel. Older versions of such packages still reside in the Bioconda channel, and as such are included in the recipe count (a) and download count (d) categories.&nbsp;Statistics obtained Oct. 20, 2017.</div>
