<div data-label="209284">Dependency structure, workflow, comparison with other resources, and turnaround time. (a) largest connected component of directed acyclic graph of Bioconda packages (nodes) and dependencies (edges). Highlighted is the induced subgraph of the CNVkit&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{27100738}</cite> package and it's dependencies (node coloring as defined in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{497928}</span>c, squared node represents CNVkit). (b) Github based development workflow: a contributor provides a pull request that undergoes several build and test steps, followed by a human review. If any of these checks does not succeed, the contributor can update the pull request accordingly. Once all steps have passed, the changes can be merged. (c) Turnaround time from submission to merge of pull requests in Bioconda. (d) Comparison of explicitly life science related packages in Bioconda with Debian Med (<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/">https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med</a>), Gentoo Science Overlay (category sci-biology,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/gentoo/sci">https://github.com/gentoo/sci</a>), Biolinux&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Field_2006}</cite>, Homebrew Science (tag bioinformatics,&nbsp;<a href="https://brew.sh/">https://brew.sh</a>), GNU Guix (category bioinformatics,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/guix/">https://www.gnu.org/s/guix)</a>, and BioBuilds (<a href="https://biobuilds.org">https://biobuilds.org</a>). The lower panel shows the age since the first release or commit. Statistics obtained Oct. 20, 2017. </div>
